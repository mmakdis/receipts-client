# Receipts Client
This is a client written in React to showcase the API data.
It's included in a different respository because it should be. However it's the main (and currently only) client that uses the API.

Maybe there's a possibility in the future that a different client is written, i.e. a mobile app.

## Get started
Start with `npm start` to play around.
